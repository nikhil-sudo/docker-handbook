What is Docker?

Developing apps today requires so much more than writing code. Multiple languages, frameworks, architectures, and discontinuous interfaces between tools for each lifecycle stage creates enormous complexity. Docker simplifies and accelerates your workflow, while giving developers the freedom to innovate with their choice of tools, application stacks, and deployment environments for each project.


## Why use Docker?

Some of the key Aspects of Docker:
* Easy to install
* Ease of managing the dependencies for a project.
* Ease of setting up you code on a new Machine / Friends Machine :D
